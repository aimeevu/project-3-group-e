#   <h2>  Project 3 | Group E </h2>
<h1>Gun Violence in America</h1>


<p>
Description:
We all know that gun violence in the US is prevalent, but is gun violence getting worse over the years? For our project, we will use an interactive  <br> dashboard to show viewers the impact that guns have had over the years across the US. How has the pandemic impacted gun violence? Has gun violence <br>  increased in a certain state, and does being a red state or a blue state affect their safety from the dangers of guns? Our goal is to create a visual <br> presentation of the data that we find to answer these questions.
